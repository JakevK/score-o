            <p>Click on a control to select it, then click on another control to join them together.</p>
            <p>The aim is to create the shortest route which connects all the controls on the map.</p>
            <p>If at any point you want to start again, just click the "clear" button.</p>
            <p>Once you're done planning your route, click "done".</p>
            <p>That's it! Give yourself a moment to admire your route or compare it with the optimal one. After that you
                can
                move on to a new course.</p>
            <p>Have fun!</p>
